# Flask Tutorial Blog Site

This is a sample blog site created by following the official [Flask tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/).

## Installation

This project is not installable as of right now. This may come in the future. I have a wheel file, but I don't know if that works. This will be updated as I learn more.

## Usage

This project is a web application. You can register for an account (that will be stored locally if you download this program), login with said account, and create, update, and delete your own blog posts.
Screenshots may be attached in the future.

## Contributing

I think I will be working alone on this project. I plan to make this site into a personal site and produce everything on my own, so the only pull requests I'll merge would probably just be some bug fixes or something along those lines. This is definitely subject to change.

## Authors and Acknowledgments

Thanks to Flask for being cool. Also thanks to [Make a README](https://www.makeareadme.com/) and [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). I'd be lost without your resources.

## License

Undetermined/Unspecified as of right now, but will most likely be MIT.

## Project Status

Honeymoon phase. It is less than a week old right now. I have many things to do, but not very much time, so this will be updated often (as time allows...).
